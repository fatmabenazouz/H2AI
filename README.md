# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently taken the world by storm. Unfortunately, due to the constantly changing nature of the software, it is difficult for users to keep up with the latest updates in technology. So many helpful AI tools are created each year, yet without promotion and advertisement, very few of them are put to proper use. The issue is that they do not have the correct platform. H2AI aims to solve this problem.

# Features

The website includes the following features:

A Home Page that hosts our logo and navigation bar, the featured AI tools, and the tool directory.

A Tool Details Section with in-depth AI tool information, addititonal resources, and similar tool recommendations.

A Search Section that allows the user to input keywords in the search bar, in order to find an AI tool with a specific purpose.

An About Us Section that hosts team member profiles and contact information, along with info about Cyclops' mission. A contact form will also be available for users who have any questions or requests.

Additional Features allowing for users to create an account on the website, which they can then use to leave reviews of the AI tools they utilized.

# Credits

The website is a collaborative effort from the team members of Cyclops: Esther Umunyana, Alvin Katabarwa, Fatma Ben Azouz, Pierrette Umutoniwase, Beritha Niyowagira, and Mathieu Munyakazi.
